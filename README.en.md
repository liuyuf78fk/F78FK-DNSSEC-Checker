### üîç Verifying Releases

To ensure the authenticity and integrity of the files you download, please follow these verification steps:

#### 1. Import our public GPG key

Run the following command to fetch and import our official public key from the Ubuntu keyserver:

```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 9DDB7DB5ACD5B60A
```

####  2. Verify the signature on the checksum file

Check that the checksum file is correctly signed by us:

```

If all files pass the checksum verification, your downloads are authentic and untampered.
